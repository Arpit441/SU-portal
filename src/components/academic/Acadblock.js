          <p>
            Situated in the backdrop of the famous Rock Garden, this site is
            divided into two parts: the Old Academic Blocks and the New Academic
            Blocks. The Old Academic Blocks, consisting of 7 beige and
            umber-bricked structures named from Block A to G, have been the
            refuge for tutelage since the foundation of our college in 2008. On
            following the path of the Marine Drive from the main gate, the sides
            of Block A would be visible, and on trekking the mini-uphill, you
            are greeted with the beautiful entrance of Block C that is enveloped
            by green patches of grass, symmetrically dividing the A and B Blocks
            on itâ€™s right and the D and E Blocks to its left. A and B blocks are
            home to the Biology and Chemistry laboratories respectively while D
            and E blocks have the entrepreneurship Incubator and Sandbox where
            innovative ideas can be honed and tinkered. The Mechanical
            Department also operates in the E Block.
            <br />
            <br />
            The central C Block serves as the administrative block
